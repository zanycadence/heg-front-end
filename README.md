# HEG Front End

Hemoencephalography is a neurofeedback technique that measures changes in cerebral blood flow as an indicator of increased neural activity in a cortex of the brain. [HEGduino](https://www.crowdsupply.com/alaskit/hegduino) is a low cost HEG device that can operate over WiFi or Bluetooth LE.

The goals of this project are as follows:

* Use the experimental WebBluetooth API to connect to, read, and display measurements from the HEGDuino device.
* Learn more about the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) web app framework, including unit testing using jest
* Learn more about the [Taucharts](https://taucharts.com/) library to display the data collected by the web application

Eventually, this front-end will be paired with a robust backend to associate measurements with users, adding things like authentication, authorization and persistent storage of readings.
